I know many developers who shudder when confronted with an internal platform that they're forced to use when delivering software.

It's funny, because many of those same developers love Heroku.

- Isn't my cloud a developer platform?
- For smaller organizations, platforms can be an expensive over-optimization.

Reasons cited for platforms:
- Paved road
- Undifferentiated work
- Toil


There are different motivations.

Disempowering:

- We want to make sure developers work in the right way, so we will limit how they can work (electrified guardrails)
- We want to reduce duplication of effort, so we will centralize the ownership of common capabilities and require sharing (gatekeeping the silos)
- We want to let developers focus on their code, so we hide everything else (obfuscation layer)

Empowering:

- We want to help developers work in the right way, so we will provide ways for them to get feedback as they go (shifting left, accelerators)
- We want developers to be able to avoid reinventing the wheel when they don't need to, so we make it easy to share, extend, and modify services, capabilities, and code
- We want to let developers to be able to focus on the right context, so we organize our systems and services around domains


Also,

- Define standards for how to build shareable services, including APIs, integration, testing, delivery, and operability.
