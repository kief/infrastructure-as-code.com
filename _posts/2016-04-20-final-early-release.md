I've delivered the text of my book to O'Reilly's production team, which means we're on the path to publication! The last "early access" release should be available soon to people who have bought it (which you can still do from the [O'Reilly Shop](http://oreil.ly/1JKIBVe)), and then the final release will be out in stores.

The final early access push will be pretty much the final content, only missing copyediting (spelling, grammar, etc.) and professionally designed graphics.
