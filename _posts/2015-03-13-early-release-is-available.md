I'm excited to announce that an "Early Access" (Raw and Unedited) version of the _Infrastructure as Code_ book is now [available for purchase from the O'Reilly shop](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920039297.do)!

This includes the first three chapters of the book. People who buy the early access edition will get updates as I add more chapters and revise the existing ones. When the final version of the book is published, you'll get the final ebook bundle.
