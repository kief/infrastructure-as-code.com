In the past year or so the economy has tightened and interest rates have made money expensive. Many investors are no longer willing or able to wait patiently for returns from businesses that are still establishing their business models. This has led to pressure on companies whose business model involves allowing users and third parties to benefit from their investment in products and services without paying in cash. Some business leaders who built their companies on open source are now declaring that open source is not a viable business model.

Building a business by investing in open source is a challenging, and even risky approach, but the fact that many companies haven't made it work doesn't mean it's unworkable. A successful open source business model involves more parts to its value chain than a closed source model. When a company hasn't been able to get the return they're looking for, it's usually because part of the value chain isn't strong enough. Worse, many companies respond to this by disrupting the other parts of their value chain, which tends to weaken the entire proposition.

The "flywheel" model that Jess Holbrook discusses in his article [Why flywheels are better than everything else you are supposed to "need"](https://medium.com/@jessholbrook/why-flywheels-are-better-than-everything-else-you-are-supposed-to-need-87b2f07554c4) is a good way to think about this. A traditional, closed-source product business model has a simple flywheel:

Investment in the product creates value for users, who pay license fees that enable further investment.

An open source flywheel has an additional loop:

The inner loop is similar to the loop for a closed-source product, but doesn't create revenue. Additionally, the value of the open source product doesn't come only from the investment of the group that owns it, but also from the users, community, and broader ecosystem around it.

The key to building a successful business around this is the additional, outer loop. The company offers some products or services which customers do pay for. The open source product feeds into this outer, revenue-generating loop by creating interest from its users and ecosystem.

Here's the trick. It's not enough just to offer products and services for sale. Those services need to offer enough value to be worth paying for. A successful commercial business model will leverage the company's ownership of the open source product to make their commercial offering more valuable than what competitors offer. Maybe their deep understanding of the open source product is enough, but only if they're also good at executing the commercial offerings.

Too many open source businesses sell commercial products that aren't very compelling to their users, and complain about "freeloaders". If you're upset that someone isn't paying for your product, the blame isn't with the users. It isn't with the competitors who make a better offering. The problem is with what you're offering.

What some companies are doing goes even further. The failure of customers to buy their commercial products leads the company to look at what they're giving away for free, and decide their problem lies there. They look at their business model with the commercial product lens. Why are we investing in a product and letting people use it without paying for it? Why are we letting other businesses use our investment to build services that our customers find more useful than what we offer?

When an open source company decides they need to drive revenues from the central value loop of their open source product, they tamper with that loop. Look again at the difference between the commercial product flywheel and the inner loop of the open source flywheel. The open source loop generates value from and for the users, from and for the community, from and for the ecosystem.

Only a fraction of that value leads people to pay the company at the center of the flywheel. But tampering with the inner loop by cracking down on "freeloading" users drives users away, decreasing the value of the ecosystem as a whole. Cracking down on freeloading business looking to earn money from that ecosystem also decreases its value, by removing options for its users.

An open source business model can only succeed when you're selling something truly compelling and valuable to users. 

* Is the open source software valuable enough that it's not viable to charge for it? The core docker product (build and run containers) is an example of something that's not. It's too simple to replicate. Docker changed their licensing to force users who only wanted the core docker product to pay for a license that included additional features. Users didn't find the commercial features compelling, and could easily find free alternatives for the features they did want.
