The second edition of Infrastructure as Code is out! Mostly. E-Books are available now
([Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Infrastructure-Code-Dynamic-Systems-Cloud-ebook/dp/B08Q35FM4B/?tag=kiefcom07-20) |
[Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Infrastructure-Code-Dynamic-Systems-Cloud-ebook/dp/B08Q35FM4B?tag=kiefcom07-20) |
[Amazon.in](https://www.amazon.in/Infrastructure-Code-Dynamic-Systems-Cloud-ebook/dp/B08Q35FM4B/?tag=kiefcom07-20) |
[O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/infrastructure-as-code/9781098114664/)), while the dead-tree version is trundling across rails, roads, and sea lanes towards your local bookshop. I'm told to expect it out in January 2021.

This is super exciting for me, and I hope people find the new edition useful. I talk a bit about the book on the [book page](/book/). I rewrote pretty much the entire book - 4 years is a long time in this field.
