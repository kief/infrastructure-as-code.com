A number of companies that were built around open source products have struggled as the economy has tightened up. Companies like Docker, Hashicorp, and Elastic have found that people are using their software, and even building products and services on their software, but not enough people are buying their own products and services to give them the return their investors expect.

The frustration from investing in developing software that creates so much value without seeing a return leads investors to decide that open source is unworkable for a commercial business. And the efforts of companies to find ways to get a return from their investment leads many in the open source community to decide that commercial businesses can't be trusted as participants in the open source community.

Open source can be a part of a successful business strategy, but it isn't a business model. A business model involves creating value and getting a return from it. Open source involves creating value and giving it away. Not only giving it away free as in beer, but giving it away free as in take it and use it as a part of your own business.

Most of the businesses that have struggled with open source as the core of their strategy didn't find a successful business model, because they thought open source was it. Their business model amounted to create value, give it away free, and then sell something on top of that. Their problem was either that the "something" that they were selling wasn't valuable enough that people wanted to buy it, or that somebody else could offer the same thing cheaper or better.

Docker created a ridiculous amount of value for the industry by establishing a standard way to package, distribute, and run software. But anybody else could and did write software that does that, so it wasn't a product Docker could make money from. So Docker sold Docker Desktop, a product that added "enterprise developer" features. Not enough of the market was interested in buying those features, so it didn't work.

Hashicorp created enormous value by giving us Terraform, Vault, Vagrant, along with other awesome tools. But they're selling a hosted service that, in spite of several rebrandings and rebundlings, not enough customers are willing to pay for. It doesn't help that Hashicorp prices those offerings for the top end of the market, which has created opportunities for new entrants to compete. Hashicorp has tried to block competitors by changing their licensing away from open source, and the jury is still out on what that will do.

Hashicorp and Elastic have both suffered from deep-pocket competitors offering paid hosting services using their open source products.
