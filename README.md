# What is this?

This is the content for my website, https://infrastructure-as-code.com. I've made it public so people can raise issues and pull requests.


# Contributing

Keep in mind that the content of this site is owned by me. I am looking into licensing it under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license. But I need to be clear on ownership of any contributions, because I need to retain the right to use the content here under different licensing, for example I may publish the content commercially myself.

I try to attribute when people give me feedback, suggestions, etc. for content here. I'm not always perfect about this, so if I've forgotten to attribute something that you gave me, please let me know so I can fix it.


# Build

The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), with the [Freshman21](https://github.com/yulijia/freshman21/) theme.
